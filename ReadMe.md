# <u>JavaScript Gym</u>

Welcome to the JavaScript Gym! This is my personal repository for practicing JavaScript programming exercises and notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the JavaScript Gym, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and programming concepts. You should also have a code editor installed on your computer, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.

## Usage

This repository contains various practice exercises and notes that I use to improve my JavaScript skills. You can find them in the `exercises` directory.

To use this repository, simply clone or download it to your local machine and open the files in your code editor. You can then read the notes, review the code examples, and complete the exercises.

Feel free to modify the code examples and exercises to suit your learning needs. You can also add your own exercises and notes to the repository as you progress in your learning.

## Collaboration

As this repository is intended for personal practice, it is not open for contributions from other developers. However, if you have suggestions or feedback on any of the exercises or notes, you can use pull requests to communicate with me. This can help us both practice GitHub and improve our skills.
